## Finance Enhancement for Local Currencies

Chelo is a DeFI platform that allows local currencies to provide financial services to the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs or SMBs). It is built on top of Local Stablecoins and it allows the members of a community to activly participate in creating financial reslience to the local businesses.

Local currencies have been in the mind of people for a long time. Still, they have never been able to unleash their true potential, which is promoting the circular economy of local communities (e.g., Bristol pound, which failed in the current iteration). The circular economy not only means that more money stays locally, which is a great benefit in a globalise, big corp. world, but also that local businesses that serve the community become more resilient to global shocks (e.g., Covid). In Chelo, we want to make Local Currencies thrive by helping them provide financial solutions to real needs with the potential to disrupt local economies and the financial industry.

Additionaly, SMEs have a strong need for coverage, competitive cost, and non-collateralised financial solutions in order to become more resilient, and we believe that the knowledge, financial strength, and behaviour of strong communities is highly underexploited for that purpose. For us, that the best way to achieve SME resilience is by empowering the circular economy of a community, with the addition of a credit multiplier.

Local Currencies projects can be enhanced with Chelo's first three products from our **Community Finance Model**: (i) **Community Lending**: we have structured a unique product that can deliver competitive rates without the need of collateral, (ii) **Community Equity**: by sharing profits, and (iii) **Community Support**: instead of paying high transaction fees to banks, give the option to donate them to local charities and artistic projects.
